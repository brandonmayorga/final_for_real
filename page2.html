    <h2> Start of it all </h2>
<p> On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the
   New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, a game the NBA now regards
    as the first actual game played in the NBA history. People forget  that the
      Knicks won that night, but the NBA then is considered boring to the current
      standards of the NBA. That game was from a different
     era of basketball when the scores would be low. Players did not instinctly
     double-pump or dunk. The truth is the players couldn't jump well and weren't
     "good" to todays players. Nor was there a 24-second clock; teams had unlimited
       time to shoot. The jump shot was a special and rare sight, because people thought
       that only bad things would happen if people left there feet to shoot. </p>
