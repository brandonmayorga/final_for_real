    <h2>The New Competition </h2>
<p>There are now more teams within the NBA with a lot more talent and competetion then
back in the days. There are now 30 NBA teams all trying to win the NBA championship
when back in the days there wasn't many teams competeting. There are some teams currently
in the NBA that have been dominating the past few years like the Golden State Warriors
and the Cleveland Cavaliers, they have both been to the last two NBA finals and
are trying to make it 3 times this season. But there are some young teams that are
trying to end that by drafting young players to start fresh so they can dominate
in the coming years, some teams doing this process are the Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns,
and the Philadelphia 76ers. </p>
  <h2>What makes the current NBA more competitive? </h2>
  <p> Yes, its true that players were more aggressive back in the 90's, but that's
  because the NBA has implemented more rules now. The competiton has risen now because
players have gotten better, there skills have improved and everyone wants to win. Back when
the NBA had originally started until the late 90's players weren't very skilled
dribblers and defenders but now players take time to focus primarily on the two.
I also think the NBA is more competitve now because when everyone talks about what team
has the best franchise it's always the Lakers or Celtics because they have the most
NBA titles in the whole league. There are more superstars in the league, it's almost
like every team has at least one superstar or one player growing to become that star.
