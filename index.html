</nav>The NBA is a league that was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the
Basketball Association of America. The league then adopted the name National
 Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with its rival National
 Basketball League. And thats how the NBA was created.

        <h2> Fun Facts </h2>
<p>First things first, if you didn't know NBA stands for National Basketball
Association. Everyone knows a lot of things about the NBA but I don't think people
know the weirder or unusual facts about it. One of those things is that most people
didn't know that the smallest player ever to play in the NBA was 5'3, was a first
round pick and his name was Muggsy Bouges. Another crazy one is that one of the
Celtic's star, Ray Allen's name was actually Walter. A funny one is about one of
the greatest basketball player's ever, Kobe "Bean" Bryant. People always thought
that Bean was just a funny nickname of his but it's actually his middle name. Wilt
Chamberlain is the only rookie of the year to ever lead the league in scoring.
Wilt averaged 37.6 points per game that year, he had been playing for the Philadelphia
Warriors at the time. Even with that great accomplishment he even led the league
with 27 boards per game. Charles Barkley, one of the greatest scorers in NBA history
 only played two years of High School Basketball. He was cut from the team during his
freshman and sophomore years.</p>
